** Q4
*** Constants
- `::` :: nil (empty index when used in {{L[::]}})

*** Functions
- enlist :: creates a singleton list from the argument
- -3!   :: "toString"
- .Q.s1 :: "toString"
- flip :: транспонировать матрицу (rectangular list)

*** Operators (?)
- , :: joining two lists;
- ^ :: merging (coalescing) two lists;
- ? :: find in list (if element is not found, the list length is returned). Able to find a multiple elements (like q)1001 1002 1003?1003 1001);
- til :: takes a non-negative int ~n~ and returns a list on ~n~ consecutive natural numbers starting at 0;
- distinct :: returns the unique items in its list arguments in order of accurence;
- where :: returns the indices of ~1b~ in a boolean list
- group :: takes a list and returns a dictionary with each distinct item of the argument is mapped to the indices of its occurence: ~q)group "i miss mississippi"~
- ~ :: matching (returns ~true~ if operands are identical)
- neg :: negate number (do NOT use minus ~-~!)
- | :: greater (for binary data might be written as `or`)
- & :: lesser (for binary data might be written as `and`)
- : :: amend ("assign in place"). See paragraph 4.6.3 "Amend with list" for magic
- ,: :: appends list in place: `L1,:L2`
***** Numeric Operators
- sqrt, exp, log, xexp, xlog :: square root, base e to the power, natural logarithm, n to power, logarithm on base
- div :: division (integer)
- mod :: modulo (remainder)
- signum :: well, signum
- reciprocal :: = 1%x
- floor and ceiling :: as you'd expect. To truncate to the given number of digits: ~0.01floor 100x~
- abs :: absolute value
***** Operations on Temporal Values

уупс, ну хоть так?
