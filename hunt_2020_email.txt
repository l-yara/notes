Hello Lee!

This is to inform you that I've started looking for the new role as my current Senior FX ETrading Developer contract with UBS is going to expire near the end of March. The extension, while already promised, is going to be inside IR35 which is not too good in my situation (I do need my Ltd to be alive). Please find my fresh CV attached; I hope for at least £800/day "inside IR35" but ready to go much lower - say, to £600 - for outside one.

Also I consider myself a good candidate for the roles like Team Lead / Lead Developer outside Financial Sector, particularly with exotics like BPM or XText. This will definitely require me to amend my CV so let me know if you have ones.

Have a great week ahead!
