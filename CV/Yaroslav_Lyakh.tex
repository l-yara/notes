\osection{Career Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emp{Formed and led the Software Development team} (up to eight people) in a multi-million GIS MT project for Gazprom gas-transportation giant. Our role in this project constantly increased due to the high level of technical and business expertise developed by team members combined with collaborative rapport built with our partners.
\item Introduced a number of system design improvements, particularly enabling a \emp{massive multi-threading data processing} on top of Spring Integration infrastructure with Fizzback team. The scalability level is now sufficient for any foreseeable load.
\item Designed and developed the \emp{data collection, verification and migration infrastructure} for Utility and Oil \& Gas - specific databases (both spatial and attribute parts). The changes in the business process proposed by our team and backed by our software enabled a productivity increase in 3-4 times compared to old approach.
\item Holding two \emp{patents} awarded on IT innovations in \emp{Data Presentation} and \emp{Data Visualisation} areas.
\item As a \emp{Principal Developer / Architect} made a key contribution to the success of the PS\&E project when worked for Kring LLC. Despite unusual team configuration and inconvenient technology set the system showed \emp{good performance and reliability} achieved with a \emp{purpose-built testing facility}.
\item Built a set of the state- and local- budget \emp{data management tools} when worked in a large KPMG consultancy projects for the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The projects enjoyed the great success and were credited with eliminating 2 months from the budget development cycle.
\item Two times won the special prizes in \emp{``Thinking Out of the Box''} nominations during the traditional \emp{Hack Day} events in MapInfo / Pitney Bowes.

\osection{Career History}
\jobdes{ION Trading: London, UK} {July 2013 - Present}{Senior Software Developer}
{Java 7, distributed multithreaded low-latency systems. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins, Acceptance Testing with the Robot Framework. TDD( jUnit + Mockito), Visual VM, Maven, Git, Groovy, JRebel, RMI, Scrum, peer reviews}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Re-designed the Query Execution module transforming it from the single-node to the distributed parallel executing subsystem.
 \item Enhanced the Continuous Integration infrastructure, re-implemented a project-specific Maven plugins. Streamlined the existed Robot Framework modules which increased the test reliability and reduced the test execution time.
 \item Implemented the Attribute Replacement feature which greatly improved the system’s configuration flexibility and made administering and configuring the whole system much more convenient.
 \end{itemize}

\jobdes{Fizzback (now NICE Co): London, UK} {June 2011 - July 2013}{Senior Software Engineer}
{Java 6, multi-threading, Spring (Core, Spring Integration, SpEL, Spring Roo), Hibernate, Activiti BPM, Groovy, jUnit, Mockito, Visual VM, Maven, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), Python (Jython) SMS-based mobile communicating, Mac OS, Linux, Scrum, peer reviews}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Refactored and enhanced a set of modules enabling a massive multi-threading data processing on top of Spring Integration pipelines.
\ifFullVersion
While for some modules it was enough to re-code the critical pieces with the standard “stateless or immutable” approach, the main part of existed system required deep re-design based on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) messaging-based architecture and extensive use of Java multi-threading tools.
\fi
The changes in performance were constantly monitored using jMeter and VisualVM.
 \item Database access (initially built on top of Spring Roo) also required serious redevelopment work, particularly related to Hibernate-vs-explicit caching. It took a lot of efforts to get rid of locking-related problems; some modules were completely re-built until the required level of performance and reliability was achieved.
 \item In addition to usual scalability improvements deeply re-developed the Communication and Reporting sub-modules to make them more convenient in configuration and maintenance. These changes (like introducing ad-hoc configuration DSL and flexible report templates) greatly improved overall system's maintainability and customer provisioning time.
 \item 	Improved the project’s Maven structure to speed-up the whole Unit Testing process (mostly due to database-related optimisation). Initiated use of CI service (Jenkins) as a key component of the team’s Scrum Agile methodology approach.
 \item Developed good working relations with colleagues from Operations, QA, and Customer Support departments; combined with good ``pure'' development work this allowed to decrease an average response time of defect handling process and improved overall IT team flexibility and confidence.
\end{itemize}

\jobdes{ScanSafe Inc (now part of Cisco): London, UK}{July 2010 - June 2011}{Senior Software Developer}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Designed and implemented various parts of a major Web Security system based on a set of parallel running services being executed in a cloud environment. This included a lot of re-design work, particularly switching from the standard Java objects to the immutable structures in combination with elements of functional-oriented programming. Data structures like tries and algorithm tricks like specifically built hash functions were used to provide the required scalability level (up to 10 million requests per day).
 \item Implemented Data Analysis and Reporting modules with sophisticated “on-the-fly” SQL query building and serious database performance tuning including some PL/SQL programming.
\end{itemize}

\jobdes{Pitney Bowes (MapInfo): Chatham, UK}{July 2008 - April 2010}{Senior Software Engineer}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
 \item Took a key part in major system redesign and redevelopment works managed around the Scrum methodology. Innovative approaches like LINQ and SaaS were also featured in this project together with some elements of functional-based design which allowed to cut down the codebase size; the stability and reliability of the whole system also improved.
 \item Suggested and implemented a number of innovations like Finite-State Machine formalisation of business logic and using flexible BPM workflow patterns in system architecture. This allowed us to build a powerful and flexible user-friendly product; the project codebase size was reduced in size and simplified.
\end{itemize}

 \item Lead the offshore development project of a major Public Safety and Emergency (PS\&E) system development. The project consisted of the server part built on Java (conversion of existing military Terma FlexCCIS Command and Control Information System) and mobile clients based in .Net Compact Framework (C\#). Modules for interacting with on-board GPS receivers and specialised communication hardware were implemented along with purpose-built integration testing facility.
